# Install Rust

This document serves as a reminder to myself rather than documentation. To install `rust`, follow the instructions at

<https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html>

```bash
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```

I needed it to compile something from source. If I end up using `rust` more, I'll document it here.
